# Supervised Learning
1. Logistic Regression - Already implemented in this repo. Please check and replicate the same in ml repo. Mention log loss function.
1. Neural Network - python implementation is done using nn.py - step by step approach, also mention why non-linear functions are required
1. Some more activation function - ReLU, Leaky ReLU, tanh and their derivatives
1. Multi-Class Classification using softmax. Softmax is implemented in python in softmax.py
1. Adam Algorithm - Adaptive Momentum Estimation

# Unsupervised Learning
1. Convolutional Layer
1. k means Algorithm - python implementation is done in k-means.py
1. Anomaly Detection - python implementation is done in anomaly_detection.py

# Questions you need answer to
1. Is it that neural network can fit any function?
1. Can Neural Network automatically fit any non-linear function too?
